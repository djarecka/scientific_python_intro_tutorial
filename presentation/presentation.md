### <span style="color:purple">Programming languages</span>

- There are multiple programming languages people are using, and they differ:
   - low-level vs high level
   - compiled vs interpreted
   - general-purpose vs domain-specific
   - static vs dynamic typing
   - open source vs closed source
   - different design philosophy

### <span style="color:purple">How to run Python</span>

- To execute Python code you can:
    - open a standard interactive session: type `python` in your terminal
    - open an interactive session with ipython (you have to install first): type `ipython` in your terminal
    - write the code in a file with `.py` extension using plain text editor
    (e.g. gedit, nano, vi, vim, emacs) and execute the code by running python 
    interpreter from the terminal - `python your_code.py`
    - using IDE (Integrated Development Environment): 
    IDE provides additional features such as code execution, code linting, testing and debugging
    - using jupyter notebook: a web-based interactive computational environment,
    can be used to create documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text 
    
Today, we will use an online interpreter:

### <span style="color:purple">Python libraries</span>
   
- In order to do anything useful in Python we need to use libraries
- Python has two main typesof libraries:
    - belong to the standard library
    - do not belong to the standard library
